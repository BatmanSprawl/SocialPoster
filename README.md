Social Media Poster Script

~-~-~-~-~-~-SCRIPT~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-

I've created a comprehensive Python script for posting to multiple social media platforms with secure 1Password integration. Here's what the script includes:
Key Features:

Multi-platform support: Instagram, X (Twitter), Bluesky, and LinkedIn
Secure credential management: Uses 1Password CLI to store API keys safely
Character limit checking: Warns you before posting if content exceeds platform limits
Image upload support: Handles image attachments for supported platforms
Flexible posting options: Post to individual platforms or all at once
Error handling: Comprehensive error handling with clear feedback

Setup Requirements:

Install dependencies:
bashpip install requests requests-oauthlib

Install 1Password CLI: Follow the guide at https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/
Sign in to 1Password CLI:
bashop signin

Create API credential items in your 1Password vault with these exact names:

"Social Media - Instagram API"
"Social Media - X API"
"Social Media - Bluesky API"
"Social Media - LinkedIn API"


Configure API credentials for each platform in their respective 1Password items:

Instagram: access_token, instagram_account_id
X: consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, access_token_secret
Bluesky: identifier, password
LinkedIn: access_token, person_id



Usage Examples:
bash# Post to X only
python social_poster.py -p x -t "Hello world!"

# Post to multiple platforms
python social_poster.py -p x bluesky linkedin -t "Check out this cool project!"

# Post with an image
python social_poster.py -p instagram x -t "Beautiful sunset!" -i ./sunset.jpg

# Post to all platforms
python social_poster.py -p all -t "Big announcement coming soon!"

# Check character limits without posting
python social_poster.py -p x bluesky -t "This is a test message" --check-only
Important Notes:

Instagram API limitations: The Instagram Graph API requires a Facebook Page and Instagram Business Account, and doesn't support text-only posts.
API Setup: Each platform requires you to register for developer access and create API applications to get the necessary credentials.
Rate limits: Each platform has different rate limits. The script includes basic error handling for this.
Security: Never hardcode API credentials in your script. The 1Password integration ensures your sensitive data stays secure.

The script is extensively commented to help you understand each section and make modifications as needed. Each function explains what it does and what APIs it calls, making it easy to customize for your specific needs.
